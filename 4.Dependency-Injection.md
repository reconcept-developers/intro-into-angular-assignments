# Dependency Injection

1. create a new component
2. add a number input
    use (change) to get the value into the component class
3. generate a new service
4. give the component a property to hold the current number
5. inject the service into this new component
6. when number input changes, also update the current number in the service
7. also inject the service into the component with the totals
8. create a method in totals component that returns the total value (`this.total + this.yourService.number`)
9. replace the references in the template from `total` to this new method
